## Variable Types
In C, different types of variables are used to store different kinds of data:

- `int` type variables can store integer numbers.
- `float` or `double` type variables can store decimal numbers.
- `char` type variables can store single characters.

## Declaring a Variable
To declare a variable in C, follow this structure:

```c
int number = 10;
```

Here,
- `int` specifies that `number` is an integer-type variable.
- `number` is the variable name.
- `10` is the value assigned to `number`.

### Alternative Declaration
You can also declare a variable first and then assign a value to it later:

```c
int number;
number = 10;
```

## Declaring Multiple Variables in One Line
You can declare and initialize multiple variables in a single line:

```c
int number1 = 10, number2 = 20, number3 = 30;
```

## What is a Variable?
A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. The value of a variable can change as the program runs.
